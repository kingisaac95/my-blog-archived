Hi everyone!

It's been a while I wrote technical articles, phew(cleans sweat). I honestly don't know what to ascribe it to. Maybe I lost motivation, maybe I stopped thinking that I know enough to share, or maybe I was just plain lazy :) - we all are sometimes. Whatever the reason, I've had this constant nudge from within, a thing inside me, pushing me to go back to writing and sharing knowledge.

To keep this interesting for me, I decided to create my own blog, a central place where I can post all my articles. I built this blog using gatsby's `gatsby-theme-blog`, and it took me a few days to finish it because my goal was not just to set this blog up, but to understand this "thing" called `gatsby`. I can tell you that this tool is amazing.

If you don't know what `gatsby` is, according to [their official website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps"

After deciding to build my personal blog, I was faced with chosing a name for it, and I settled with `Boffin`, which means a person engaged in scientific or technical research. That description resonated well with me because I'm on a journey of technical research, and this blog will house the results of my research.

Join me in this journey!

_Happy hacking, and more bliss!_
